## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SASS / SCSS
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

In this challenge I try to use SCSS to help me create the design. While this is the first time I'm using SCSS, I can see this tool being useful for larger scope of website development. In this challenge I also try to implement BEM methodolody to naming my markup classes.

### Continued development

- The hover states of navbar still need some works, tho I still don't know how. Maybe I'll visit again in the future once I learn new technique to fix the the issue.
- The solution I implemented to create lightbox and cart can still be improved. In fact I believe my solution is still too direct and inefficient. I'll visit again in the future.
- Adding more breakpoints so the design is more fluid accross multiple breakpoints.
- I believe my BEM naming skill still could be improved, but I guess it's something that goes with my time as it goes hand in hand with my marking up skill.
